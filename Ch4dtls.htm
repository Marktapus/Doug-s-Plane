      <h3><font color="#FF0000">TIPS / WHAT I DID...</font></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>I used the CAD drawings available on Marc's website - <font size="2" face="Times New Roman"> <a href="http://www.cozybuilders.org/cad_files/" target="_blank"> CLICK HERE</a>
          </font>.&nbsp; Cut the blueprint copies along the lines, then used a
          fine point Sharpie to trace the outline of the cut copies.</li>
        <li>I cut all the foams with a utility knife and metal
          straightedge.&nbsp; Only needed a few passes on the Seatback and
          Landing Gear Bulkheads.&nbsp; For the Last-A-Foam (F22, F22Doubler,
          F28, and IP) made multiple passes along the &quot;outside&quot; of the
          Sharpie line, then tapped a razor blade with a hammer along the cut
          line to finish the cut. Then a few light passes with a Perma-Grit
          block quickly shaped to the line.&nbsp; Perma-Grit blocks/tools also
          worked great to fine tune Firewall cuts.</li>
        <li>Don't get hung up on making the edges of the bulkheads
          &quot;perfect&quot;; you will get them right during the trial fit in
          Chapter 6.&nbsp; I would mark the edges per the drawings, then leave a
          little extra (1/16&quot; or 1/8&quot;) to work with where the part
          will meet the Longerons</li>
        <li>Used the &quot;Hinge Method&quot; to 5 minute epoxy bulkhead pieces.
          <font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><a href="misc%20files/Chapter%203%20-%20Builder%20Tips%20-%20Preparation.pdf" target="_blank">See
          Chapter 3 Research Summary</a></font>&nbsp; for more details</li>
        <li>Used Wayne Hick's method for sliding plies onto work, and recommend
          that new builders use it as well.&nbsp; <font color="#0000FF" size="2"><a href="http://www.maddyhome.com/canardpages/pages/waynehicks/tips_laying_plies.htm" target="_blank">CLICK
          HERE</a></font> to read more about it.</li>
        <li>When working with UNI: use 1/2&quot; masking tape to mark cut
          lines.&nbsp; Then cut down center of tape to keep edges from becoming
          frayed.&nbsp; Leave taped edges in place, cutting only where needed
          when laying plies down.&nbsp; Also, measure carefully to maximize
          cloth use.&nbsp; Also ended up doing this with the BID - It seemed to
          keep the cloth from deforming while handling.</li>
        <li>If you're new to working with glass, identifying small air bubbles
          can be little difficult - especially when everything is
          &quot;wetted-out&quot;.&nbsp; To me, the small air bubbles below a ply
          of glass look like poison ivy blisters.&nbsp; When I find them, I like
          to make multiple light passes using the squeegee, working the bubbles
          toward the edges with the &quot;grain&quot; of the glass.</li>
        <li>Peel-ply - I seemed to achieve the best results, by laying glass
          (per plans orientation), then Dacron peel-ply, then a heavy (~4 mil)
          plastic &quot;peel-ply&quot; a la <a href="http://canardaviation.com/cozy/tips.htm" target="_blank">John
          Slade technique</a> (see reference towards bottom of page).&nbsp; This
          gave me the uniform finish that John mentioned, yet still allowed me
          to avoid extra sanding prior to future lay-ups.</li>
        <li>Put some Dacron peel-ply down on F22 over the 3/8&quot; space on
          each side of the doubler before glassing on top of the doubler.</li>
        <li>Added .25&quot; to bottom of IP</li>
        <li>Consider waiting on getting an epoxy pump.&nbsp; You may be able to
          save yourself some money and aggravation.&nbsp; <a href="Ch3dtls.htm" target="_blank">See
          Chapter 3 - Tools</a></li>
        <li>Fein tool does a nice job of trimming glassed parts if you miss the
          knife trim window.</li>
        <li>Used .25&quot;x2'x4' MDF as temporary firewall; marked with W.L. 23,
          W.L. 0, and Centerline.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>For the firewall : Made 1.5&quot; square inserts, beveled 45 degrees
          on two parallel sides, vs. 1&quot; inserts called for in
          plan.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you plan on doing the same thing, then adjust your
          order accordingly from the supplier. (I received a 2&quot;x 3&quot;
          section of 2024 Alum. from Wicks).&nbsp; Also, for the blind screw
          installation, I ground down both sides of the heads and custom cut
          each channels to avoid the dreaded &quot;spin&quot; (see below).</li>
        <li>Following tips from others, used highlighter in plans to mark
          completed steps.</li>

      <h3><font color="#FF0000">SEATBACK - Done...maybe&nbsp;</font></h3>
      <p>Used a jigsaw (20 tpi blade) to cut 45 degree angle.&nbsp;&nbsp;Varied
      from plans by not bringing fiberglass over sides and floxing to front
      sides.&nbsp; I did, however bring the top and bottom edges together.&nbsp;
      During fuselage assembly, I plan on channeling the sides out before
      floxing.&nbsp; As a side note - I also had three &quot;exotherms&quot;
      (one pure epoxy, one slurry, one flox) - I'm assuming because I mixed too
      much epoxy at a time.&nbsp; Weight - 5.7 lbs (Map pocket not cut).&nbsp; I
      am considering rebuilding or modifying the seatback to add a
      &quot;pass-through&quot; panel on the passenger side.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>NOTES:&nbsp; During trial fit in Chapter 6, this part required the most
      adjustment.&nbsp; Leave yourself a little extra where this part, and the
      other bulkheads, will intersect with the longerons.&nbsp; Also, keep in
      mind (for all parts) that the longerons will not have a 90 degree edge,
      but will be rounded slightly.&nbsp; Therefore, the bulkheads should not
      have&nbsp; &quot;crisp&quot; corners. &nbsp;I would also just draw the
      center map pocket and heat duct cut-outs, and wait to cut them until
      Chapter 6.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>The razor tap method worked fine.&nbsp; However, I learned quickly that
      you only need to rough cut the high density foam.&nbsp; The Perma-Grit
      block takes the edges down quickly, accurately and with no
      effort.&nbsp;&nbsp;Varied from plans by glassing the forward side before
      doing the aft side.&nbsp; Figured it would be easier to weight down with
      the thicker build-ups on each side vs. having the doubler on the top
      only.&nbsp; Hopefully that won't come back to haunt me.&nbsp; A little
      tip: Put some Dacron peel-ply down over the 3/8&quot; space on each side
      of the doubler before glassing on top of the doubler.&nbsp; This will prep
      the 3/8&quot; area, and keep the &quot;run-off&quot; epoxy from building
      up there.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Added .25&quot; to bottom of IP.&nbsp; Note at the time of the photo,
      only the center &quot;connectors&quot; had been sanded with the Perma-Grit
      block.&nbsp;Glassed on both sides, working on adding stiffeners.&nbsp;
      Following the advice of others, I used sealed blocks wood as forms for the
      channels.&nbsp; I had some uncertainty about adding the electric channels
      on the vertical stiffeners since it appeared that some others had
      not.&nbsp; In the end, I went ahead and put them on - figuring I can always
      trim them off if the weren't needed.</p>
      <p>Added picture: When I have excess epoxy at the end of a lay-up I try to
      have small items ready to be glassed/floxed.&nbsp; One of those items are
      the leg holes in the IP.&nbsp; I channeled out the foam and filled the
      void with flox.&nbsp; After cure, I filed and sanded the edge flush.</p>
      <p>NOTES:&nbsp; I used the CAD drawings and added the .25&quot;.&nbsp;
      When it came time to install in Ch.6, I had to trim most of the excess
      back off.&nbsp; But, this was certainly easier than having to add
      more.&nbsp; If I had to do it again, I would just glue the basic parts
      together, glass both sides, then trace the drawing onto the part and cut
      to shape with the Fein tool.&nbsp;</p>

      <h3><font color="#FF0000">LANDING GEAR BULKHEADS - Done</font></h3>
      <p>I rough cut the foam around the areas adjacent to where the hardpoints
      will be be inserted.&nbsp; That way I can adjust for any slight
      differences that may occur when I cut out the hardpoints. (Note the
      blueprint template to the side) -- One point of interest: the forward
      landing gear (designed to be installed at angle) was the one part that the
      CAD drawings appeared somewhat different than the M drawings.&nbsp; I
      decided to stick with the CAD drawing shape since the dimensions appeared
      true and the M drawing contained an interruption.&nbsp; Used 24 plies to
      make hardpoints, then used LG Bulkhead foam scraps as supports to control
      the thickness while the part was weighted for cure.&nbsp; The finished
      part came out a perfect thickness.&nbsp; Note that the picture at left
      makes it appear that there are more &quot;dry&quot; spots than there
      really are.&nbsp; After cure, used a jig saw with metal cutting blades to
      rough cut hard-point shapes.&nbsp; Then I held pieces together in a vise
      and used the Perma-Grit tools to finish shaping.&nbsp; Taped the edges of
      the finished pieces (like the hinge method) when inserting in the
      bulkheads with 5-minute epoxy.&nbsp; Then peeled quickly for a clean
      installation.</p>
      <p> Side note - Tried masking off the sides of F28 and the LG
      Bulkheads to prevent the epoxy and micro run-off from seeping around to
      the underside of the part that I was glassing.&nbsp; This didn't work, and
      certainly wasn't worth the time.</p>
      <p> <b>NOTES</b> - If you are planning to use Wayne Hick's alternate
      Landing Gear Cover (as I am), then you may want to add an 1/8th inch along
      the bottoms, including the NACA cutout section, of each of the landing
      gear bulkheads now.&nbsp; {Do not change the top half of the forward LG
      Bulkhead, as it does not come in contact with the fuselage bottom.}&nbsp;
      In Chapter 7, you'll find that these bulkheads are designed to be below
      the fuselage bottom to create &quot;joggles&quot;.&nbsp; Wayne's method
      does not require joggles, so the 1/8th will need to be added then if you
      don't do it now.&nbsp; Also, if you add the 1/8th inch now, then in
      Chapter 6 (Fig. 32) you will need to relocate your block to 3/8th inch
      below the scoop cut out to insure that the fuselage bottom mounts flush to
      the cutout.</p>

      <h3><font color="#FF0000">FIREWALL (S) - Done</font></h3>
      <p>Longeron markings on .25&quot;x2'x4' for Temporary Firewall.&nbsp;
      After rough cutting Permanent FW with 20tpi jig saw, finish shaped with
      Perma-Grit blocks (I LOVE THESE BLOCKS/TOOLS!!).&nbsp; Used clamps to hold
      the two &quot;connector&quot; pieces together, and the PG Block onto the
      table.&nbsp; This allowed me to get two identical parts.&nbsp; I plan on
      using 1.75&quot; round aluminum hardpoints (a la Bernard Siu).&nbsp; After
      more thought on the matter, I decided to insert square hardpoints.&nbsp;
      However, instead of the 1&quot; x 1&quot; size called for in the plans, I
      went with 1.5&quot; x 1.5&quot; squares.&nbsp; This decision was based on
      some references that the 1&quot; x 1&quot; inserts had a minimal margin of
      error.&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally, I filed 45 degree bevels on two parallel
      sides of each insert.&nbsp; Then I inserted the hardpoints with the bevels
      facing aft, resulting in an exposed 1.25&quot; x 1.5&quot; rectangle on
      the aft side (see picture at left).&nbsp; Though the plans didn't specify,
      I used standard epoxy and flox vs. 5 minute epoxy to install the
      hardpoints.</p>
      <p>After reading all the comments about the dreaded &quot;spinning&quot;
      of the blind screws, I decided to grind the tops of the screws to create a
      &quot;T&quot; shaped bolt.&nbsp; I then carved each channel so the now
      rectangular shaped tops (see picture at left) had no room to spin.&nbsp;
      Hopefully the increased resistance added by the channels, coupled with the
      flox, will prevent the &quot;spins&quot;.</p>
      <p>Note - The CAD drawings show the blind screws (on the two small pieces
      that connect the bottom and top firewall) sitting higher than the plans
