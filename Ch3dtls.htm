      These are the &quot;Getting Started&quot; chapters. You need to decide to
      build a Cozy, order &amp; review plans, and begin the education process
      (although by now most future builders have spent a great deal of time
      reading about homebuilt aircraft, composite construction, and what others
      are doing).&nbsp; Chapters 1 and 2 are self-explanatory, but you may find
      some interesting notes about the Bill of Materials at <a href="http://www.maddyhome.com/cozy/chapter?c=2" target="_blank">Rick
      Maddy's site</a>.&nbsp; Chapters &quot;0&quot; and 3 are more involved,
      and honestly ongoing.&nbsp; In this section, I'll highlight the steps
      taken in preparing my hangar (a.k.a. Garage) for the build.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
      <p><font size="5">In preparation for each chapter I plan on reviewing what
      other builders have done or are doing.&nbsp; I've attached a PDF file that summarizes this research.&nbsp; I'll include these summary documents

      Start date of the project will be 9/11/05 - so I have until then to review
      the plans, and develop my plan of action to ensure the project is
      completed by 9/11/10.</p>

      <h3><font color="#FF0000">WORK TABLE</font></h3>
      <p><b>6/06/06</b> - Well, after a long delay, began building the work
      table (Unfortunately, the basement project is still not finished, but I
      can see the light at the end of the tunnel).&nbsp; I decided on a 3.5' x
      12' work surface, with a 2&quot; overhang on all sides. Started by digging
      through the lumber pile at Home Depot and selected three straight 2&quot;
      x 8&quot; x 12', three 4&quot; x 4&quot; x 8', four 2&quot; x 4&quot; x
      8', two 4' x 8' x 3/4&quot; plywood, and two 4' x 8' x 3/8&quot; masonite
      boards.&nbsp; I needed an additional 108&quot; of 2&quot; x 8&quot;, but I
      already had remnants at home from the basement project.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Using those remnants, I cut two 38&quot; pieces of 2&quot;x8&quot; for
      the ends.&nbsp; Then I cut the three 2&quot;x8&quot;x12' boards to
      137&quot; in length.&nbsp; With the &quot;best&quot; edge (read
      'straightest') facing down I framed out the joists, keeping the middle
      joist at 19&quot; on center.&nbsp; Measured corner to corner to square
      structure, then I measured to the middle of each outside joist for
      positioning the center legs.&nbsp; Cut the 4&quot;x4&quot; timbers to six
      36&quot; lengths, and measured 29&quot; from the bottom of each leg.&nbsp;
      Using this mark, attached each leg to the corners and center.&nbsp; Added
      cross-members in center to prevent joists from twisting.</p>
      <p>For the lower shelf, I measured 6.5&quot; and
      10&quot; from bottom of each leg.&nbsp; Then I cut four
      2&quot;x4&quot;x32&quot; support beams, attaching them between these marks
      and 1.5&quot; from the outside edge .&nbsp; The center legs have two
      support beams - one on each side (see picture to left).&nbsp; Next, I cut
      four 2&quot;x4&quot;x63.25&quot; to connect the support beams and form the
      support frame for the lower shelf.&nbsp; Like others I used a 1/4&quot;
      threaded bolt, nut and washers in the center of each leg to allow for
      independent height adjustment.&nbsp; I also attached a piece of masonite
      to the bottom of each leg to help prevent the washers from setting into
      the pressure treated 4&quot;x4&quot; (see picture to right)&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      After that it was time to turn it over.&nbsp; Daughters Jillian and Paige
      got on one side, and I took the other.&nbsp; Topped the table and lower
      shelf with the 3/4&quot; Plywood.&nbsp; Enlisted Paige's help again when
      it came time to finish the top with the masonite.&nbsp; (Paige received
      extra praise because not only did she help with the table - but, she mowed
      the lawn as well - allowing me to have the time to work on the table and
      basement. --- Yeah Paige!!!).&nbsp; Took a picture, and then stuck a fork
      in it...The table is done.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

      <h3><font color="#FF0000">TOOLS</font></h3>
      <p><b>Sticky-Stuff Dispenser</b> - Bought an epoxy pump because I had used
      one on another builder's (<font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#0000FF"><i><a href="http://www.stealthturtle.com/index.php/building-an-airplane-cozy-iv" target="_blank">Nate
      Wolfe</a> </i></font>) project.&nbsp; At the time, I liked it a lot.&nbsp;
      However, now that I have used the pump at home, I would recommend that
      builder's consider waiting to purchase one.&nbsp; It does not appear to be
      worth the maintenance trouble, unless you are planning to lay down a large
      volume of epoxy or if you use the pump on a regular basis (at least
      once/week).&nbsp; The biggest trouble I had was the oxidation/degradation/crystallization/discoloration
      of the hardener if left in the pump for an extended period.&nbsp; So far,
      I have found that on smaller lay-ups (anything on Chapter 4) I actually
      prefer using a scale and &quot;squeeze bottles&quot; to batch mix my
      epoxy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p><b>12/10/06</b> - Over the last few weeks I bought some tools that I'm
      interested in trying out.&nbsp; The first is this 24&quot; digital level
      from Craftsman (P/N 48293).&nbsp; I picked it up on sale at Sears for
      ~$45. I thought it would make a nice lower cost alternative to the
      smart-level tool from the suppliers.&nbsp; Features include: reads angles
      to 1/10 of a degree, reads right side up or down, audible tones at 0,45,90
      degrees, recalls last 9 measurements, calculates degrees between two
      angles, projects laser dot to 100 feet, uses tripod threads or hangs
      magnetically.&nbsp; The second tool is this B&amp;D cordless
      scissors.&nbsp; I'm not quite sure how well it will work, but it was so
      inexpensive (~$10 on sale) I couldn't pass on giving them a try.</p>

      minimize dust/dirt from getting into cabinet.&nbsp; Added interior shelf
      and supports for rolls of cloth.

      <p><b>6/16/07</b> - A GREAT DAY - Thanks to Tim Lumpp, I got my Cozy
      wings!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;I was on duty last night when Tim called to let me
      know that he and Terry Schubert (the Long-EZ driver at left) were flying
      into Delaware County (OH) airport.&nbsp; He offered me a ride in his
      beautiful Cozy if I could find my way to the Fly-In.&nbsp; I found a
      way...(Thanks to Jack K. for attending a meeting in my place)
      <p>Due to my size,&nbsp; I was expecting to ride in the back; especially
      since Tim is about the same size as me.&nbsp; However, the two of us still
      fit within the envelope, so I was bumped to First Class.&nbsp; Tim was
      very generous with plane and allowed me lots of stick time.&nbsp;
      Everything about the plane (almost 100% per plans) met or, more often,
      exceeded my expectations.&nbsp; The day was perfect, and the visibility
      through the canopy was incredible.&nbsp; As Tim suggested, the
      &quot;stall&quot; was one of life's greatest non-events - just the
      predictable canard bob.<p>So how does someone follow-up on such a terrific
      day?&nbsp; Besides repetitive 'Thank You's', I went straight home to cut
      my first pieces of foam!!!&nbsp; Tim, thanks again for the perfect
      day.&nbsp; It was a pleasure meeting Terry and seeing you again.&nbsp; I
      appreciate the time and advice you both gave me.&nbsp;
