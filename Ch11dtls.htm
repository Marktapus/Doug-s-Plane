      <h3><font color="#FF0000">TIPS / WHAT I DID...</font></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>On the straight edge templates, I put talking points at every
          1/2&quot;; I would recommend putting a nail hole at every half inch as
          well.</li>
        <li>Check all foam pieces for damage, and determine best use for each
          piece (determine what areas will be discarded).</li>
        <li>Pay attention to how the foam is <u>weighted</u> before cutting.</li>
        <li>Use the foam cutting sequence per plan, but cut the top and bottom
          working from trailing edge to the leading edges</li>
        <li>You need MIRROR copies of the torque tubes, so be attentive to the
          placement of your NC-2 inserts</li>
        <li>Use a 1/8&quot; drill bit for the NC-2 pop rivet</li>
        <li>Like some others, I skinned the tops of the elevators before the
          bottoms</li>
        <li>If I did it again, I would have sanded a depression to allow for the
          balance weight (CS10) 2 ply UND, before glassing the skins</li>
        <li>Mounted L jigs to table before bonding elevators into position -
          allowing gravity to help hold everything in position</li>
        <li>Make sure you position tip fairing foam at enough angle to account
          for the line extensions called out for in Fig. 21</li>
        <li>Used a scrap piece of wood as a backer to stabilize the canard tip
          during the shaping of the top</li>
        <li>I used three pieces of BID, cut to shape from glass
          &quot;sandwiched&quot; between wax paper, to fill each counter weight
          pocket&nbsp;</li>
        <li>SUPPLY ORDER -- Use 4 AN3-12A bolts to attach inboard weights vs. 4
          (of 8, in kit) AN3-13A bolts provided (Change your order accordingly)</li>
        <li>SUPPLY ORDER -- The twelve AN960-10L washers needed in Step 4 are
          not provided in AS&amp;S Ch.11 package (Change your order accordingly)</li>

      � Make the airfoil templates </b><i>-&nbsp;Did this when I made the
      canard templates.&nbsp; Traced the M drawings onto
      plain paper, then used spray adhesive to attach template tracing to
      masonite.&nbsp; Since the spray adhesive gets everywhere, I covered
      the entire masonite board with thin paper towels (it's what I had
      available).&nbsp; This allowed me to still see the tracing, but prevented
      the jig saw from gumming up and staining the template drawing.&nbsp; Rough
      cut templates, then finished shaping to lines with files.&nbsp;Since so many
      builders have trouble fitting the cores to the control tube, I would
      consider making the tube notch slightly larger by using the actual tube as
      a reference.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#0000FF"><b>Step Done</b></font>&nbsp;</i>

      � Rough cut foam pieces to proper lengths (4 - 27.5&quot; pieces) </b><i> -&nbsp;My
      hotwire saw was long enough to cut a single 55&quot; core, but the plans
      recommend cutting smaller pieces for improved accuracy.&nbsp; I stuck with
      the plans method.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#0000FF"><b>Step Done</b></font></i>

      � Hotwire cut the airfoils </b><i>-&nbsp;Followed
      the cut sequence per plan, but cut the top and bottom working from
      trailing edge to the leading edges.&nbsp; This seemed much easier by
      allowing us to set the hotwire one the extended tip of the template before
      moving into the foam.&nbsp; First core had a few joggles on bottom, but
      was certainly usable.&nbsp; However, decided to make two extra core since
      I had extra foam.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#0000FF"><b>Step Done</b></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>

      � Check NC-2 fit, adjust, and secure in place </b><i>-&nbsp;Like many
      other builders, I found that the NC-2 inserts would not fit into the tubes
      without filing the tube cutout corners. I ran into a few questions at this
      point.&nbsp; First, I'm sure it said it somewhere, but I had no idea what
      size a #30 hole was.&nbsp; So I simply checked the size of the pop rivet
      and found that a 1/8<sup>th</sup>&quot; hole was a perfect fit.&nbsp;
      Secondly, when inserting the NC-2, which direction should the small hinge
      pin hole face.&nbsp; After a little thought, and study of Fig. 4, I ended
      up securing the NC-2 with the hinge pins forward.&nbsp; I understand that
      direction is a little confusion, since the hinge pin hole will be
      &quot;rotated&quot; and centered downward when installed in the
      core.&nbsp; But for now, think of the tube as if it were the finished
      elevator (leading edge, trailing edge, outboard end, and inbourd end), you
      want the hinge pin hole to be on the &quot;leading edge&quot;.&nbsp;
      Remember too, that you need a MIRROR copy for the opposite side elevator
      so be attentive to the placement of your NC-2 inserts.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      �&nbsp;Install elevators to canard - </b><i>Since I was working alone, I
      needed an easier way to set the elevators in the jigs than the plan
      method.&nbsp; To do this I attached tabs onto the &quot;L&quot; jigs so I
      could secure them with screws onto my work bench.&nbsp; Then I set all the
      jigs into position - keeping them perpendicular to bench and offset
      equally over the edge.&nbsp; Once that was done, I could easily attach the
      elevators with a few dabs of 5 minute epoxy (mixed with some micro).&nbsp;
      Once this was cured, I was able to unscrew the jigs and flip the assembly
      into position to test fit.&nbsp; The nice part (besides being able to do
      this alone) was that I didn't need to bondo the assembly onto the
      canard.&nbsp; I was able to hold everything in position by lightly
      weighting the jigs.&nbsp; This was helpful, as you may need to remove the
      assembly several times to tweak the trailing edge.&nbsp; <b>NOTE -
      remember that the &quot;L&quot; jigs have been changed to insure a full 15
      degrees up-travel so you should have ZERO gap between the elevator and
