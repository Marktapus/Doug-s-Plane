      <ul>
        <li>I used the remaining pieces from cutting out FJA to hold the top
          longerons in their jigs.</li>
        <li>Consider adding .5&quot; to forward and rear doublers to make sure
          you have enough to meet F28 and extend through firewall, respectively.</li>
        <li>I cut the masonite and foam before
      setting up the jigs.</li>
        <li>Make sure that you line up the &quot;full&quot; sheets of blue foam from
          the rear and work forward.&nbsp; This will help you avoid getting a
          seam at the control stick relief.</li>
        <li>Added 3/8&quot; to bottom of blue foam and will trim after lower
          longerons are installed.</li>
        <li>Attached the foam to the masonite with a nail gun.</li>
        <li>I marked the 30 degree and 10&quot; lines on the foam for
          references.</li>
        <li>I modified the control stick depressions, making them longer, and
          slightly higher to soften the slope.</li>
        <li>When laying the UNI, I trimmed the edges a little long for some
          &quot;wiggle&quot;room.&nbsp; Once down, I worked the UNI from the UL
          spacers toward the bottom and then cut the fabric between the two
          sides.</li>
        <li>You may want to consider adding 1/8&quot; to the bottom spacers to
          give yourself some cushion when setting the lower longerons.</li>
        <li>Positioned, spaced, clamped, and marked upper longerons before
          starting lay-up, so I could work on both as a single unit.</li>
        <li>Created channels directly into the 3/4&quot; foam rather than the
          plans' plug method.&nbsp;</li>

      <h3><font color="#FF0000">Misc Thoughts...</font></h3>
      <blockquote>
        <p>This chapter has been pretty straightforward so far.&nbsp; However,
        one thing I don't like in the plans is that there isn't a lot of
        clarification when it comes to the measurements given.&nbsp; For
        example, you start out with measurements along the flat surface of the
        blue foam.&nbsp; Now this is nice and easy, and it's pretty hard for
        even me to screw up.&nbsp; But once the foam is laid into the jigs,
        everything is three dimensional, and when measurements are given they
        are not always specific to whether they are measured along the surface,
        or along a straight line fore-to-aft. The same is true for cuts - should
        these be perpendicular to the surface, or the axis of plane?&nbsp; For
        the most part, you can figure out the intended location, but it would be
        nice to have the clarification.&nbsp; The one thing I've tried to ensure
        throughout is to make sure I remained consistent between sides so I will
        end up with pieces that are mirror images of each
        other.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

      <h3><font color="#FF0000">Cutting Jigs / Laminating Top Longerons &nbsp;</font></h3>
    <p>Screwed the two 1&quot; x 8&quot; boards together then followed plans to
    measure and cut the jigs.&nbsp; Used the scrap pieces after jig-sawing part
    FJA, to help hold the longerons in the jig.&nbsp; Marked a centerline on the
    table, then covered surface with plastic and wrapped molds (and jig clamps)
    with duct tape.&nbsp; Screwed forms, through plastic, onto table.&nbsp;
    Epoxied mating surfaces of spruce and stacked.&nbsp; Once both longerons
    were epoxied, I positioned them in the jigs and used the clamps and wood
    blocks to hold in place.&nbsp; Used small wedges to insure that the
    longerons were placed snuggly against the jigs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      I started to follow the suggestion of another builder, and removed the
      longerons (after sanding excess epoxy from the tops) from the jigs in
      order to put the doublers on using clamps.&nbsp; The parts came free
      easily, and while they retained their shape, they did lose some of their
      &quot;bow&quot; when the clamps were released.&nbsp; I figured that it was
      better if I left the parts in the jigs until the doublers had been placed
      and set.
      <p>Added note - Miscut the rear UL doubler to wrong length (15.25&quot;
      vs. plans 15.5&quot;).&nbsp; It looks like it will still extend through
      firewall, but added a little more to be sure.&nbsp; I recommend measuring
      twice, and cutting once!&nbsp; You may want to consider cutting piece to
      15.75&quot; or 16&quot; to give yourself a little cushion.</p>

      <h3><font color="#FF0000">Building the Forms (Fuselage Sides) and
      Preparing for Contouring &nbsp;</font></h3>
      <p>Following the lead from others, I cut the masonite and foam before
      setting up the jigs.&nbsp; I measured and cut the masonite first, then
      used the masonite as a pattern for the foam.&nbsp; Make sure that you line
      up the &quot;full&quot; sheets of foam from the rear and work
      forward.&nbsp; This will help you avoid getting a seam at the control
      stick relief.&nbsp; Also, per Rick Maddy's suggestion, I added an extra
      3/8&quot; to the bottom.&nbsp; I marked the 30 degree and 10&quot; lines
      on the foam for references.</p>
      <p>Instead of bondo, I attached the jigs to boards that were screwed along
      a straight line.&nbsp; I built the jigs on two 2' x 8' sheets of
      pressboard.&nbsp; This will allow me to separate the sides if needed,
      limit the screw holes into my table, and when finished, the two pieces
      will convert to doors for a garage cabinet.&nbsp; Due to the curvature of
      the piece, I found it real difficult to maintain the 7/8&quot; space
      evenly along the top.&nbsp; I did my best and got it as close as I
      could.&nbsp; I attached the foam to the jigs using a finish nailer set at
      a low pressure.&nbsp; I practiced on some scraps to make sure everything
      worked the way it was supposed to, and after a successful trial, moved to
      the main piece.&nbsp; The practice peeled of like velcro and left small
      holes(see picture) that should be easy to fill -- Hopefully, the main piece will come
      off just as easy.
      <p>Rough cut out all the 3/4&quot; foam spacers.&nbsp; Since the plans do
      not provide a lay out on the foam parts lay-out page, I decided to try to
      create one.&nbsp; Everything was going great (at least in my mind...)
      until I realized I forgot to check measurements when I moved the rail on
      the table saw.&nbsp; This caused a few miscut pieces along the bottom of
      one side (measure twice, cut once...dumbass!!!).&nbsp; I decided to use
      the miscut pieces when I contour the fuselage bottom, and recut new
      spacers from the remaining piece of 3/4&quot; foam.&nbsp; Long story
      short, mine is probably not the template to follow.&nbsp; After everything
      was rough cut, I finished forming the pieces using the Perma-Grit blocks
      and sandpaper.&nbsp; FYI - If you plan on cutting the angles using a saw,
      Jeff Wilson has calculated the angles for AA, BB, CC, and EE as 35, 33,
      34, and 17.5 degrees, respectively.&nbsp; Following the lead of others, I
      used Rick Maddy's guide for the electric channel (6&quot; from back,
      3.75&quot; slope).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may want to consider adding
      1/8&quot; to the bottom spacers to give yourself some cushion when setting
      the lower longerons.

      <h3><font color="#FF0000">Contouring the Insides &nbsp;</font></h3>
      <p>I made a few changes here.&nbsp; Attached the finished spacers per
      plans using a combination of clamps, drywall screws, and my poor man
      weights (read &quot;bricks&quot;).&nbsp; I plan on using the Atkinson fuel
      sights, and decided not to create a depression at this time.&nbsp; From
      what I've read it seems reasonable to wait, then install after I get the
      strakes in place.&nbsp; This help to make sure I've got the right
      placement, and should simplify the lay-up in the next section.&nbsp; I
      also modified the control stick depressions, making them longer, and
      slightly higher to soften the slope.&nbsp; I may go to the Cozy Girrrls'
      Strakes later on, but in case I don't, I wanted the stick depressions to
      be more subtle than the standard circles.&nbsp; The other change was in
      the plans order.&nbsp; I went ahead and glassed the electric channels
      now.&nbsp; Mostly, because I had the time, and I couldn't see the downside
      of doing it at this junction.

      <h3><font color="#FF0000">Inside Lay-up and Installing the Upper Longerons&nbsp;</font></h3>
      <p>I knew that the &quot;3-hour&quot; reference in the plans had
      frequently been called out as BS, so I was prepared for a long haul.&nbsp;
      In fact, I'm pretty sure I spent three hours just spewing
      expletives.&nbsp; Other than long, things weren't too bad if you took your
      time.&nbsp; I enlisted the help of my friend Glen (plain grey T-shirt) and
      middle daughter Paige (the first to actually help work on the
      plane...although reluctantly) to help put the UND down.&nbsp; Thank you
      Glen and Paige! Glen also mixed up some epoxy and took a turn with the
      squeegee.&nbsp; All the prep was straight-forward, the one exception is
      that since I glassed the electrical channel ahead of schedule, I floxed
      the corner where the glass-to-glass bond would be.&nbsp; I'm pretty sure
      this was unnecessary, but I figured it was a good habit to keep, and I
      think I was subconsciously stalling putting on the UND.&nbsp; The UND was
      a little akward, and I was glad that I had drawn the 30 degree
      guidelines.&nbsp; I recommend trimming the edges a little longer than
      normal to give yourself some &quot;wiggle&quot; room.&nbsp; Once down, I
      found it easier to work the UNI from the UL spacers toward the
      bottom.&nbsp; Then before adding epoxy, cut the fabric between the two
      sides so activity on one side doesn't distort the other.&nbsp; Varied from
      plans slightly when installing UL's.&nbsp; Before I started the layup I
      positioned and marked the UL's where I wanted them, then clamped the
      spacers between them.&nbsp; This allowed me to move them as a set, and it
      made it very easy to flox them and attach them when the time came.&nbsp; I
      was happy to say that it worked as well as I thought it would (hopefully I
      won't be surprised later on).&nbsp; TEN hours later, I finally left the
      garage!!!
      <p>Other notes:&nbsp; You may notice that I'm using both a scale and
      Sticky-stuff dispenser in the picture to the left.&nbsp; Because of the
      problems with the hardener oxidizing and only one hardener container
      (requiring you to premix slow and fast as needed), I pretty much only use
      the dispenser to distribute the resin, and then measure in the hardener
      using a scale.&nbsp; I would recommend that if you're looking to save a
      few dollars, don't buy the dispenser.&nbsp; Also, I ran out of slow
      hardener just as I finished... a good reminder to check your tools and
      supplies before you start!&nbsp; Despite all the checks, I had a few air
      bubbles that will have to corrected.&nbsp; Otherwise, the lay-up looked
      okay.
      <p>While I waited for the slow hardener to ship from Wick's, I went ahead
      with the rest of the chapter.&nbsp; I also prepped the UL, in anticipation
      of the 4 ply UNI lay-up, by filling the saw cuts with wood pieces and
      rounding the edges along the full length of the UL.&nbsp;

      <h3><font color="#FF0000">Installing the Lower Triangular Longerons &nbsp;</font></h3>
      <p>Deviated from plans by working on LTL's before completing the 4 ply UNI
      lay-up on the UL's.&nbsp; After removing peel-ply from lower spacers,
      confirmed and marked the required measurements between the upper longerons
      and the lower triangular longerons (LTL's).&nbsp; Then prepped the spruce
      pieces by making relief cuts so the LTL's will conform to the curves of
      each side.&nbsp; Since the sides curve on two planes, the relief cuts need
      to be made on both the corner that will be flush against the side, and the
      corner that will be flush against the bottom (installed in Ch. 6).&nbsp; I
      used a coping saw, placing a 5/16&quot; block next to the LTL as a depth
      guide, and cut at the following locations (starting from F22 and working
      backwards):

      <p>Like others, I made some blocks with 45 degree notches so clamps
      can easily hold down the LTL's, and then test fit each LTL.&nbsp; Confirmed
      measurements again and marked outlines onto the sides as guidlines for
      installation.&nbsp; Epoxied LTL's and rear doublers(after LTL's were
      cured) using clamps (no
      nails), and cleaned all excess flox from parts.&nbsp; In preparation for
      the LWX and LWY measured and marked the 5.5&quot; x 8.7&quot; spar cut-out
      area.&nbsp; Since this measurement is made from the rear line (and UL),
      you need to know where the forward and rear cut lines are going to
      be.&nbsp; So I spent a lot of time, measuring and re-measuring the
      101.75&quot; fore to aft dimension.&nbsp; Based on what I've read, I
      expected to make some slight adjustments to the angles on LWX and LWY to
      get everything to fit properly, so I made the pieces a little longer to
      allow for adjustment.&nbsp; I was pleasantly suprised when I discovered
      that very little adjustment was required!&nbsp; Like the LTL's, I
      confirmed the measurements and traced the outlines as guides, then floxed
      into place using weights and clamps to secure.

      <h3><font color="#FF0000">Finishing the Fuselage Sides&nbsp;</font></h3>
      <p>Deviated from plans for creating the electrical channel and filling the
      lower rear areas.&nbsp; Instead of creating a mold for the electrical
      channel, glassing, installing, then filling the surrounding area with
      3/4&quot; foam, I filled the area with foam, then created the electrical
      channel in the foam.&nbsp; To me, this just seemed to make more
      sense.&nbsp; Used wax paper to create a pattern to cut out the foam.&nbsp;
      Had a small moment of reassurrance when the pattern fit into both sides
      equally.&nbsp; Then it was a simple matter of cutting and sanding foam to
      fit.&nbsp; Once the pieces were cut, measured and marked the
      channels.&nbsp; Used a razor to score the channel edges, then a
      combination of chisels and files to finish.&nbsp; Glassed the channel,
      then set the pieces in with micro (with my two co-pilots watching). Cut
      BID and completed 6-ply layup over lower rear section.&nbsp; Used packing
      tape to mask off areas where I didn't want run-off.&nbsp; In the picture
      to the left, you'll also notice the UNI cut and rolled for the 4-ply layup
      over the UL's.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Completed the 4-ply UNI layup on the UL's.&nbsp; Due to the size, I
      decided to lay/work one ply at a time versus creating a large multi-ply
      tape.&nbsp; This worked out fine, as I just took my time and didn't
      encounter any problems.&nbsp; Since the UL will be cut foward of F28, I
      didn't worry too much about the glass aft of the forward doubler.&nbsp; I
      rolled out the UNI from the front doubler keeping the fibers
      straight.&nbsp; As I approached the rear doubler, I made a small
      &quot;pinch&quot; of the cloth between the two sides then continued
      unrolling the UNI.&nbsp; This made it easier to form the glass over the
      rear doubler.&nbsp; After a 36-hour cure, I removed the peel-ply, cleaned
      up the part, and the removed it from the jig. Pop, Pop, Pop...the part
      came right up and only left small holes on the exterior foam that will be
      easily filled prior to glassing.&nbsp; Since it felt like a milestone,I
      had my daughter Jillian take a picture of us removing the side (that me
      with the blue shorts on the left).&nbsp; Then, after a lot of measuring
      and re-measuring, my friend (Glen) and I completed the sides by trimming
      the foam and longerons per plans.&nbsp; As a side note - I had a lot of
      fun playing with the spar section cut-out; in particular, using it to
      demonstrate that although it was very light, it easily supported my full
      weight.&nbsp; Even my wife feigned interest!</p>
